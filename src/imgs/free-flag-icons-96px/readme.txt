BLOGGING.COM FREE FLAG ICONS

Blogging turns you into a hunter of sorts -- especially when it comes to free images. Many freelance bloggers don't have the luxury of a fat stock photo allotment. Instead, we're constantly on the prowl and we have a keen sense of smell for tracking down free images. Cue Homer Simpson: "Mmm... free images with attribution." So delicious!

Here at Blogging.com, we live to serve. That's why we're handing out a free pack of 244 international flag icons rendered in a design that's both modern and sharp-looking. Did we say free? Yes, free!

Each of the 244 flag icons in our free icon pack comes in three different sizes, for a total of 732 PNG image files. See for yourself

This global flag icon set is free to use for any purpose, commercial or personal. ALL WE ASK IS THAT YOU GIVE US ATTRIBUTION SOMEWHERE ON YOUR WEBSITE OR ON THE PAGES IN WHICH YOU'RE USED. Just paste the HTML code below into your attribution page. The attribution is also a great way to help your fellow bloggers find these flags and use them too.
